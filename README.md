#Change django project name

##How to change a django project name

The first thing we need to do is download [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

Once we downloaded whe have to launch it, to do this go to `pycharm > bin ` and execute `.pycharm.sh`

Now click in `Create New Project` and select the location of your project and your interpreter

Click `create` and yes

In this new window right click in your project directory and select `replace in path`

Now we have to write in `text to find` the name of our project, `my_project` in this case and write in `Replace with` the new project's name

Click `find` and a new windows will appear showing all the files where the project name is, click in `replace` if you want to replace it, if you not want to do this click in `skip`. Maybe you can click `skip` if you have logs and the project's name appear several times.

Finally, we have to change the directories names to the new ones and check that the django project works
